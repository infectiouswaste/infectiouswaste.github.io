**Curiosity:** When creators see some creation, apart from simply being impressed, she wonders how it is built, what was the inspiration. Being curious is an essential part of any creator. Anything a creator consumes, be it a book, a movie, a song, a piece of code, a business model, or a dish, she wants to know more to satisfy her inner desire.

**Being Hands On:** To what extend one attributes an achievement to her own capability defines a creator from a consumer. A critical temprement of humanbeing is to use the tools. But a creator always seeks to not only use the tools, but also improve on existing tools and create new tools.

**Patience:** Mastering an art takes a great amount of time. Our contemperary society does not reward patience. But true creators know the importance of the foundations and daily practices. The power of compound-interest will eventually reward patience for true creators.

**Aim for the Best:** Creators have confidence of creating great stuff. They have accurate self-assessment on their capabilities. Also, in any field they create, they tend to know the history, the state-of-the-art, and are always ready to push the edge. That is why they celebrate fellow creators' achievements as together the field will meet new challenges, and keep advancing.

**Being Innovative:** A creator may start small and gradually grow her own M.O.. But eventually she needs to make breakthroughs, again and again. Distainful of repeating oneself is the motivation to innovate. And with patience and a solely goal of achieving the best, a creator shall innovate.

**Enjoy the Process:** Focusing on the end results kill the joy of creation. It is all the blood and sweat in the process that defines the greatness of a creation. As artificial tools become more prevailing in our daily lives, a true creator controls her mind and action in the whole creating process.

For all the fellow creators on this beautiful planet, I salute you. Together we will change the world for the best.
