*Artist using a perspective machine. Albrecht Dürer, 1525*

Since Darwin's age, people have been using graphics hardware to creating pictures. Early such grahics hardware includes perspective machine. If you look closely enough, it has several features of modern graphics hardware: it does the transformation of perspective, and it is discrete (by sampling on the surface of the objects one wants to draw, then finish the whole drawing with smoothing method).
