>  What is the most important thing you could be working on in the world right now? ...and if you're not working on that, why aren't you? ---Aaron Swartz



Hopfield made substantial contributions (Nobel-contention work) in multiple fields, which is truly astonishing: Kinetic proofreading (biochemistry/biophysics), HopNets (ML), long distance electron transfer (physics), and much more.

I agree that Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines are a surprisingly arbitrary choices. It is like they wanted to give a prize to someone for neural networks, but had to pick people from inside their own field to represent the development, which limited the range of options. There is also the aspect of the physics community wanting to give somebody that they liked a Nobel, and then trying to fit them in. (The prize isn't handed out by a shadowy committee of Swedes, there's an involved and highly bureaucratic process for nomination that requires your colleagues to take up your case.)

The physics prize has historically taken the role of both "innovation/engineering" topics and "mathematics". It's more broad than simply physics.

The most important factor tends to be the positive impact on society, as that's one of the price's core tenets.

    Mathematical Contributions: Theoretical advances that rely heavily on mathematics have also been honored, acknowledging the importance of mathematical frameworks in advancing physics.
    Positive Societal Impact: A common thread among these awards is the significant benefit to society, whether through new technologies, improved understanding of the universe, or practical applications that enhance daily life.

My perspective as a PhD in theoretical physics, who's been doing deep learning in the last 4 years:

1. The prize itself makes zero sense as a prize in _physics_. Even the official announcement by the Nobel Prize Committee, taken at a face value, reads as a huge stretch in trying to link neural networks to physics. When one starts asking questions about the real impact on physics and whether the most important works of Hinton and Hopfield were really informed by physics (which is a dubious link to the Nobel prize anyway), the argument stops holding water at all.

2. Some of the comments mention that giving prize for works in AI may make sense, because physics is currently stalled. This is wrong for several reasons: 2.1. While one can argue that string theory (which is, anyway, only a part of high-energy theoretical physics) is having its "AI winter" moment, there are many other areas of physics which develop really fast and bring exciting results. 2.2. The Nobel Prize is often awarded with quite some delay, so there are many very impactful works from 80s which haven't been awarded with a Nobel prize (atomic force microscopy is a nice example). 2.3. It is wrong to look at the recent results in some sub-field and say "okay, there was nothing of value in this field". For example, even if one completely discards string theory as bogus, there were many important results in theoretical physics such as creation of conformal field theory, which was never recognized with a Nobel Prize (which is OK if Nobel Prize is given to other important physical works, but is quite strange in the light of today's announcement).

To finish on a lighter mood, I'll quote a joke from my friend, who stayed in physics: "Apparently the committee has looked at all the physicists who left academia and decided that anything they do is fair game. We should maybe expect they will give a prize for crypto or high-frequency trading some time later".

############################
In some sense it makes sense to award AI researchers on behalf of the physics community because I know many physics PhD’s who thank their job to AI; they work as data scientist now.

Jokes aside, physics is a bit stuck because it’s hard to do experiments at the boundaries of what we know, as far as I understand. So then it makes sense I guess to award people who made useful tools for physics.

######################################
Most commenters here don't know that Boltzmann machines and associative memories existed in condensed matter physics long before they were used in cognitive science or AI.

The Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model of spin glass is a Hopfield network with random initialization.

Boltzmann machine is Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model with external field.

This is price in physics given to novel use of stochastic spin-glass modelling. Unexpected, but saying this is not physics is not correct.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The methods may be inspired by physics, but they have made no contribution to understanding physical laws or phenomena.

It's mathematical/CS work. The connection to actual physical laws or phenomena is even more tenuous than the prize for exoplanets a few years ago.
######################################

Also arguing that NN is used in physics so we can argue nobel prize is okay is like asking for Stephan Wolfram to be awarded Nobel prize for Mathematica which is much more used in physics as a tool. And he is a physicist and had contributions to the field of numerical relativity (The reason he created Mathematica in the first place).

The royal science academy fucked up so much with this choice.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Has NN led to any fundamental breakthrough in physics research? I understand the impact from NN to scientific research, but I'm not aware of any big results in fundamental physics research because of NN.

As a former Alumni of Hinton’s MOOC I can attest to his humble, kind nature and clarity, & erudition as a teacher.

Modelling learning as entropy, and heat in his Boltzmann machines was genius as was the 1980s backdrop paper.

Geoff tirelessly evangelised neural nets and machine learning right from his 1970s phd days at Edinburgh.

Despite being in the academic wilderness during the many decades of symbolic AI.

Moore’s law ( & parallel processing via GPUs ) finally caught up with Geoff’s vision and proved him right.

Well deserved !

This is totally bizarre, no precedent for it really. The reality of the prize means that less and less are the winners names every physicist has heard of, but even today they're still big names in each subfield. For e.g. Kosterlitz, Thouless and Haldane weren't exactly household names but they really deserved the prize in 2016.

In this case, there's a good argument that Hopfield had conducted strong work as a physicist and in physics, but Geoffrey Hinton has never worked as a Physicist, at best adopting some existing things from physics into cognitive science use cases. In any case, what they've been given the prize for is work where they've not contributed to the understanding of the world of physics - it's not even really an arguable case where this is work that crosses over between Physics and another field either. It'd be like if Black or Scholes had been given the Physics prize rather than Economics because their famous equation can be re-written in Schrodinger equation form.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is embarrassing. I would say Hopfield networks aren't even very revolutionary in neuroscience, but they're so old I can't tell. In terms of AI... they've been irrelevant for thirty years. I guess you could argue a transformer is a generalized Hopfield network, but of course that's a post-hoc understanding. None of this has anything to do with physics.

So what if an energy function lets you approximate the number of macro-states it can capture? Should every mathematics paper with Lagrange multipliers be put up for nomination? Every poll that uses the law of large numbers, and thus, entropy? Surely the computer scientists building the internet need to be included as well, since their work is based in information theory.

Or maybe, hear me out, we reserve the Nobel Prize in physics for advances in the physical sciences, understanding physical reality or how to bend it to our will.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
When the most significant advance since electrification needs to hop the fence to be recognized, perhaps it's time to add a new field. It can be done, the Economics prize was added in 1968.

Feynman was a well-known proponent of AI and neural networks [1]. He even gave popular lectures on the subject [2]. He also claimed that replicating animal-like visual recognition abilities in machines would be Nobel-worthy; deep learning was certainoy a breakthrough in that.
