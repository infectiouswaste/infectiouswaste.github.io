> What to put here?

vision does not come for free.
incoming electrochemical signals have to be interpreted by the brain, and that happens only with practice.

perception is active: fetching information on a need-to-know basis

roughly 30% of the brain is devoted to constructing vision.

much of what we see comes from unconscious inference: our expectation of what be believe is "out there"

other senses:

back in 90s, a pregnant woman's husband put a long nail from top of her head.
after carefully examined, CT scan showed the nail.
She was a victim of bad marriage, which is very common back in those years.
during recovery, she was saved, but the nail affected the part that deals with language, esp how we pronounce double-character words.

Other senses.

---------------

conscisousness is a stream.
conscious perception is an active process: one that requires attention.
binocular rivery
synchronization of input is important for attention

how does the activity of billions of neurons, synchronized or not, produce conscious experience itself?
