> What to put here?

vision does not come for free.
incoming electrochemical signals have to be interpreted by the brain, and that happens only with practice.
sensor sells are our windows to the outside world.
roughly 30% of the brain is devoted to constructing vision, comparing to 8% for touch, and 3% for hearing
it's a small windows but good enough for our survival. Actually 390nm to 750nm compared to the full frequency range of electromagnetic radiation is an infinitesimally small range (1/1b). But we can survive on that!


perception is active: fetching information on a need-to-know basis
eye movement when seeing a picture
blind spot and filling in effect
multistability necker cube. more than one way to interpret the same visual input.
binocular rivary: two images for two eyes
competing at higher level interpretation.

an organism doesn't require all of the data in the world around it. It simply figures out
how to retrieve the data it needs.

saving resources by embedding prior experience
internal models of the outside world allow the brain to save time and resources and to come to rapid perceptual conclusions.

in this sense, the brain is a hypothesis generator, building models of the world and striving to veriry them based on input through the tiny windows of the senses.

one assumption is that vision arises from "unconscious inference", brain infers, in a blackbox manner of the outside world and we simply perceives the end results of the calculations.
the visual system relies on internal models built from best guesses, given retinal input and prior experience.

Another surprising fact is: most neural activity is produced on the inside, and it is merely altered by external sensory input.





much of what we see comes from unconscious inference: our expectation of what be believe is "out there"

other senses:

back in 90s, a pregnant woman's husband put a long nail from top of her head.
after carefully examined, CT scan showed the nail.
She was a victim of bad marriage, which is very common back in those years.
during recovery, she was saved, but the nail affected the part that deals with language, esp how we pronounce double-character words.

Other senses.

---------------

conscisousness is a stream.
conscious perception is an active process: one that requires attention.
binocular rivery
synchronization of input is important for attention

how does the activity of billions of neurons, synchronized or not, produce conscious experience itself?
