Why I hate ByteDance:

Jon Blow:
all of the history of evolution has been about creatures treating other creatures as resources.
respect, not manipulate, let alone exploit.

efficiency at the cost of almost everything else.

 - centralization
 widespread of automation (bots)
 minimize redundancy
 unify
 argraculture, finance, media
 we make decisions/take instructions from bots

 much simpler systems than singularity can trap our civilization

 whether tech liberate or enslave us?

 bot:
 search, retrieval, act
 weak AI, decides your mortgage,
 decide your education
 your job interview
 biological info, personal info
 insurance decisions
 listens to us too.

 this is called dystopia

 unblinking eye and ever listening ear

 our data->key decisions

 collective control of internet seems to be losing

 bots != tools

 what's the benefit?
market price for forced labor
smaller group of people knowledgable
to sustain human civilization

company, gov, religion,
criminal groups
hackers

giving up the decision right to everything.
never trust anything/any system except your own system: your brain
other people set objective that's optimal for them. most of the time not optimal for you.
